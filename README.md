A (WIP) manager/builder for base16. Written in Rust.

I'm developing the starting version right now, so all changes are quickly being pushed to master. Once it's stable, there will be a dev branch just for that. So don't mind the huge amount of small commits for now.

I started this project because the existing tools didn't seem mature enough or didn't quite fit my workflow.
I made a (quite functional) [bash script](https://gist.github.com/Misterio77/925243bdf3e7ce1f23654507e5326f7a), but i wanted something faster, modular and that could be used by other people without having to be rewritten each time. I've been wanting to try and make an actual rust project, so here we are.

Thanks to:
Functionality inspiration from [Base16 Universal Manager](https://github.com/pinpox/base16-universal-manager).
Logo inspiration from [Starship prompt](https://starship.rs)
