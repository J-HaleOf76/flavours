## What
This is a CLI program that both builds and manages Base16 schemes and templates.

The base16 specification consists of both schemes (with 16 colors) and templates. There'll probably be templates for most applications you use, but you can easily make one for literally any app that supports any sort of color customization.

You can easily apply a specific (or multiple, then flavours picks one at random) scheme (`flavours apply pasque`), or glob pattern(s) (`flavours apply "gruvbox*"`). Supports tab completion for many shells (including scheme completion on zsh).
You can also list schemes (`flavours list`) and get your current scheme (`flavours current`).


## How

### Installation
Just install cargo and run `cargo install flavours` (don't forget to include `~/.cargo/bin` on your PATH).

I use arch (btw), so i'm building an AUR package. Let me know if you want to package flavours for any other distro.

After installing, you should probably use `flavours update all` to grab all published schemes and templates from the base16 repos. If you want, you can manually tweak the templates, schemes or even the repo lists (everything's located in `~/.local/share/flavours` on Linux).

### Usage
You can use flavours and base16 templates to automatically inject schemes into any application config file that supports colors codes.

Choose a template/subtemplate for each app you want themed (or create your own).
On these config files, place a start and end comment to tell flavours where to replace lines (defaults are `# Start flavours` and `# End flavours`).

On flavours configuration (`~/.config/flavours/config.toml` on Linux), create a `[[item]]` section for each app. Specify a `file` and a `template` (optionally a `subtemplate`, a `hook` to execute, whether to use `rewrite` mode, or change the `start` and `end` lines), and vÃ³ila. You're now ready to apply schemes.

I will write some documentation soon-ish, including configuration and integration examples.

## Why
Why use this instead of other base16 managers, or even pywal?

While these projects are great and certainly fit some people's workflow, they didn't quite fit mine.

I decided to do my own project because i wanted a simple CLI program that can easily integrate with rofi, polybar, and everything else in my workflow. The main feature is being able to quickly and easily use a curated list of schemes, on all your apps.

## When
All features are implemented! I'm currently working on improving code quality and stabilizing the features, but everything should work as intended.
